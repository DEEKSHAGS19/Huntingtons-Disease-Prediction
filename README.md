Huntingtons-Disease-Prediction


Huntington's disease is a rare, inherited disease that causes the progressive breakdown (degeneration)
of nerve cells in the brain. It has a broad impact on a person's functional abilities and usually results in
movement, thinking (cognitive), and psychiatric disorders. We are analyzing the genomic data to study
the features that cause Huntington's Disease from data obtained from NCBI (National Center for
Bioinformatics) using machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and
Generalized Linear Mode
